# prog1-final-2024
## Start by running run_ball.py
python3 run_ball.py
## Then, try running seven_segments_proc.py
python3 seven_segments_proc.py
## What to do in the final exam
- Create a simulation shown in the VDO wanted_outcome.mp4
  - This simulation combines the one generated by run_ball.py with the one generated by seven_segments_proc.py
- The simulation code must be written in object-oriented style
- Use the procedural code provided in this repo as a starting point
